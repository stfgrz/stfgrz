## Hey, I'm Stefano Graziosi

### Thanks for stopping by, and welcome to my profile!

A couple of things about the person behind this account:

- ðŸŽ“ I am currently attending my first year of the **MSc in Economic and Social Sciences** at Bocconi University.
- ðŸ”­ Working on [EconShelf]([url](https://econshelf.notion.site/EconShelf)), an open-source repository of econ-related opportunities and contents.
- ðŸŒ± I have a long way to go, so **if you have any feedback** on what you see on this profile, **please contact me**!

My main interests are **monetary economics** (I think), but I'm always on the lookout for new things that might interest me.
