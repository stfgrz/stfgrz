## Hey, I'm Stef

### Thanks for stopping by, and welcome to my profile!

A couple of things about the person behind this account:

- 🎓 I am currently attending my second year of the **MSc in Economic and Social Sciences** at Bocconi University.
- 🔭 Working on [EconShelf](http://econshelf.notion.site) - an open-source repository of econ-related opportunities and contents.
- 🌱 I have a long way to go, so **if you have any feedback** on what you see on this profile, **please contact me**!

My main interests are **econometrics** (for the most part) and **monetary economics**, but I'm always on the lookout for new things that might interest me.
